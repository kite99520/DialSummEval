And, you know, not all Italian books are about pizza, mafia and mandolino. :P | Josie: Yes, I know... I should try and read one of his novels in the original, but I'm not sure my level of Italian is adequate. | Stefano: The Name of the Rose is really difficult for a foreign speaker of Italian, you know. | Josie: And what about Foucault's Pendulum? | Stefano: Well, it's set in the 1980s, so the language is definitely more comprehensible. The content, however, is just as complicated as in the other novel. | Josie: Btw, I read Salman Rushdie's review of Pendulum, published in the 80s. | Stefano: Really? What did he say? | Josie: He hated it and said that it's not a novel, but rather a computer game. | Stefano: What? Rotfl! | Josie: That's what Salman said... | Stefano: Oh well, de gustipus non est disputandum... | Josie: De gustiBus! | Stefano: I know, it was a typo! | Josie: Disgusting pus! | Stefano: Hahaha. | Josie: Yuk!
