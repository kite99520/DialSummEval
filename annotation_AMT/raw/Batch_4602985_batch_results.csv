<p>Kai: where have you been now?</p>
<p>Michael: argentina brazil and chile</p>
<p>Kai: wow! how long?</p>
<p>Michael: 2 weeks, lots of flights to make it work. I'm in Boston next weekend!</p>

<p>Michael: true, in my field it wouldn’t be good. Anyway I need to speak to my manager and discuss because I’m not happy in my job now. How’s everything on your side? too much work?</p>
