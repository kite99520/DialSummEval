<p>Stefano: So, what about Foucault's Pendulum? Do you like it?</p>
<p>Josie: It's... weird. Was it really written by an Italian guy? It's so... nerdy.</p>
<p>Stefano: Oh well, in a sense Eco was the king of nerds. And, you know, not all Italian books are about pizza, mafia and mandolino. :P</p>

<p>Stefano: The Name of the Rose is really difficult for a foreign speaker of Italian, you know.</p>
<p>Josie: And what about Foucault's Pendulum?</p>
<p>Stefano: Well, it's set in the 1980s, so the language is definitely more comprehensible. The content, however, is just as complicated as in the other novel.</p>

<p>Josie: It's... weird. Was it really written by an Italian guy? It's so... nerdy.</p>
<p>Stefano: Oh well, in a sense Eco was the king of nerds. And, you know, not all Italian books are about pizza, mafia and mandolino. :P</p>
<p>Josie: Yes, I know... I should try and read one of his novels in the original, but I'm not sure my level of Italian is adequate.</p>
<p>Stefano: The Name of the Rose is really difficult for a foreign speaker of Italian, you know.</p>
<p>Josie: And what about Foucault's Pendulum?</p>
<p>Stefano: Well, it's set in the 1980s, so the language is definitely more comprehensible. The content, however, is just as complicated as in the other novel.</p>
<p>Josie: Btw, I read Salman Rushdie's review of Pendulum, published in the 80s.</p>
<p>Stefano: Really? What did he say?</p>

<p>Stefano: The Name of the Rose is really difficult for a foreign speaker of Italian, you know.</p>
<p>Josie: And what about Foucault's Pendulum?</p>
<p>Stefano: Well, it's set in the 1980s, so the language is definitely more comprehensible. The content, however, is just as complicated as in the other novel.</p>

<p>Stefano: The Name of the Rose is really difficult for a foreign speaker of Italian, you know.</p>
<p>Josie: And what about Foucault's Pendulum?</p>
<p>Stefano: Well, it's set in the 1980s, so the language is definitely more comprehensible. The content, however, is just as complicated as in the other novel.</p>
<p>Josie: Btw, I read Salman Rushdie's review of Pendulum, published in the 80s.</p>
<p>Stefano: Really? What did he say?</p>
<p>Josie: He hated it and said that it's not a novel, but rather a computer game.</p>
<p>Stefano: What? Rotfl!</p>
<p>Josie: That's what Salman said...</p>
<p>Stefano: Oh well, de gustipus non est disputandum...</p>
<p>Josie: De gustiBus!</p>
<p>Stefano: I know, it was a typo!</p>
<p>Josie: Disgusting pus!</p>
<p>Stefano: Hahaha.</p>
<p>Josie: Yuk! That's so creepy.</p>
<p>Stefano: You're the one who said it!</p>
<p>Josie: I know. ;)</p>","Stefano recommends Josie Foucault's Pendulum to read. Josie read Salman Rushdie's review of Pendulum.","5","5","5","4"
